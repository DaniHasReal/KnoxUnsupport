## 🧠 What is this?

KnoxUnsupport is a Magisk module designed to systemlessly install core Samsung Knox apps — including **Secure Folder** — on **Samsung devices that don't officially support them**.

This module:
- Installs Samsung Knox-related system apps
- Spoofs necessary props to fake minimal Knox presence
- Tries to create a working Secure Folder profile on unsupported models

*Does it fully work?*  
→ **No. It barely works. But it's fun.**

---

## 📦 What's included?

- `SecureFolder.apk`
- All them Knox apps + them permissions
- Basic `system.prop` spoofing
- `sepolicy.rule`
- All apps placed into `/system/priv-app` systemlessly

---

## ⚠️ Warning

This module is:
- Experimental  
- Unofficial  
- Unsupported by Samsung, your carrier, your cat, or reality  
- Known to break if you breathe on it wrong

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Samsung device (tested on A04)  
- Magisk installed  
- SELinux **Permissive** recommended  
- One UI / Android 14+ preferred  
- A deep tolerance for failure

---

## 🚫 Doesn't Work (Yet?)

- Knox Attestation  
- Full Secure Folder login  
- Being taken seriously

---

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Flash the module in Magisk  
2. Reboot  
3. Use *Shortcut Maker* to launch Secure Folder (it might not appear in Settings)  
4. Try not to cry when it crashes  
5. Patch more stuff (like Settings or sepolicy) if you're brave
